#  Andres Gomez Coronel

I'd like to nominate Andres to the SSC - Andres has done quite a bit of work adding to and improving code examples 
and docs, as well as working with contributors to get doc and example PRs merged.

I think Andres would make a strong SSC nominee because in addition to an understanding of the core technicals, 
Andres is familiar with how people consume, use and understand SPIFFE, and can bring that context to the SSC.
